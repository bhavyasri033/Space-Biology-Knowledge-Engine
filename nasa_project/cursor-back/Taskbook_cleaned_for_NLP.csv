artemoss experiment. 2. plantmoss morphology moss colonies remained green signs morphological aberrations every artemoss step. colony plate showed signs browning, yellowing, color bleaching. 3. bacterial fungal contamination bacterial fungal contamination spot-inoculum, petri plate, point throughout artemoss experiment. 4. quantity total rna extracted 400ng total rna extracted four (4) moss

approaches plant space biology research enabling maximize scientific return. first, unlike studies relying model plants, bring new organism, moss, remarkably adaptive extreme environments earth thus likely exhibit superior adaptability deep space environments. second, contrast studies address deep space environment separately, discover combined effects cosmic ionizing radiation spaceflight microgravity. third, contrast previous research done irradiated seeds spores leads mutagenesis rather observation effects deep space cosmic ionizing radiation plant physiology, pioneering experimental design sequentially exposes live, actively growing plants deep space environments. fourth, deploy accurate simulation cosmic ionizing radiation astrophysical origin, exposure ion beams compositions energies best approximating galactic cosmic rays (gcr) solar particle events (spe) radiation. studies used exposure electromagnetic wave radiation uvb, uvc, x-rays, gamma-rays delivered high-dose single pulse (acutely), poorly simulates deep space cosmic ionizing radiation, particulate, chronic, low-dose extended fractionations. upon completion deliver moss transcriptomic profiles, growth

exploration missions help constructing plant varieties incorporated life support systems in-space human habitation, enabling long-duration crewed missions beyond low earth orbit. secondly, since study
