# Mission Readiness Scoring Algorithm

## Overview

The Mission Readiness Index uses a rule-based scoring system to assess preparedness for long-duration space missions across five critical categories. The scoring algorithm analyzes research publications to determine evidence strength, countermeasure availability, and research gaps.

## Scoring Formula

### Base Score Calculation

```
baseScore = min(100, 10 * numberOfPublicationsInCategory)
```

### Countermeasure Bonus

If publications contain evidence of tested countermeasures, add +15 points:
- Keywords: "countermeasure", "trial", "tested", "validated", "protocol"
- Searches in: title, abstract, results, conclusion sections

### Gap Penalty

If fewer than 3 publications exist for a category, subtract -20 points:
- This penalizes categories with insufficient research evidence
- Encourages identification of research gaps

### Final Score

```
finalScore = max(0, min(100, baseScore + countermeasureBonus - gapPenalty))
```

## Score Levels

| Level | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Green** | 70-100 | Well-studied + tested countermeasures |
| **Yellow** | 40-69 | Partial evidence, some solutions |
| **Red** | 0-39 | Insufficient evidence / urgent research gap |

## Gap Confidence Assessment

| Confidence | Publications | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 5+ | Sufficient evidence for reliable assessment |
| **Medium** | 3-4 | Moderate evidence, some uncertainty |
| **High** | <3 | Insufficient evidence, high uncertainty |

## Category Mapping Rules

### Crew Health
- **Keywords**: bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiac, heart, deconditioning, exercise, countermeasure, crew health, monitoring, assessment, sleep quality, circadian rhythm, psychological, adaptation, isolation, stress, health monitoring, telemedicine
- **Focus**: Physical and psychological health of crew members

### Radiation
- **Keywords**: radiation, shielding, cosmic rays, protection, dosimetry, exposure, DNA damage, cellular repair, polyethylene, composite, active shielding, passive shielding, radiation monitoring
- **Focus**: Protection from cosmic radiation and space radiation effects

### Food & Life Support
- **Keywords**: food production, agriculture, hydroponic, nutrition, food systems, life support, closed loop, air revitalization, water recycling, filtration, HEPA, air quality, environmental control, waste management, composting, recycling, food storage, preservation, vacuum sealing
- **Focus**: Sustainable food production and life support systems

### Microbial Risks
- **Keywords**: microbial, contamination, spacecraft, environmental control, microbial monitoring, automation, real-time, sterilization, protocols, prevention, bacteria, fungi, pathogens
- **Focus**: Prevention and management of microbial contamination risks

### System Integration
- **Keywords**: system integration, deep space, modular design, interfaces, mission planning, architecture, optimization, testing, redundancy, failure modes, reliability, emergency response, medical emergency, safety, mission architecture
- **Focus**: Integration and optimization of mission systems and architecture

## Design Implications Generation

Design implications are generated using a combination of:

1. **Base Templates**: Predefined implications from category rules
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Content-based implications derived from publication findings
3. **Keyword Matching**: Specific implications based on detected keywords

### Example Implications

**Crew Health:**
- Include resistive exercise system with magnetic resistance
- Add in-flight bone density monitoring (portable DEXA)
- Implement comprehensive cardiovascular monitoring

**Radiation:**
- Implement multi-layered radiation shielding (water + polyethylene)
- Deploy real-time radiation dosimetry systems
- Design active shielding systems for deep space missions

## Future Enhancements

### NLP Integration Hooks

The system includes commented hooks for future NLP enhancements:

```javascript
// TODO: Integrate with NLP service for:
// - Evidence strength scoring
// - Automated summary generation
// - Sentiment analysis of findings
// - Confidence scoring based on study quality
```

### Potential Improvements

1. **Study Quality Assessment**: Weight publications by journal impact factor, study design quality
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Consider publication recency and research trends
3. **Evidence Synthesis**: Use NLP to extract and synthesize findings across multiple studies
4. **Confidence Intervals**: Provide statistical confidence measures for scores
5. **Custom Weighting**: Allow mission-specific category importance weighting

## Validation and Testing

The scoring algorithm is validated through:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing with mock data
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing
- **Edge Cases**: Empty datasets, invalid inputs, boundary conditions
- **Mock Data**: 30+ realistic publication samples for testing

## Configuration

Scoring parameters can be adjusted in `config/category_rules.json`:

- Keyword lists for each category
- Base implication templates
- Category descriptions and metadata

## Usage

```javascript
const analysis = computeMissionReadinessIndex(publications, 'transit', 2020);
```

**Parameters:**
- `publications`: Array of publication objects
- `env`: Environment type ('moon', 'mars', 'transit')
- `minYear`: Minimum publication year filter

**Returns:**
- Complete mission readiness analysis with scores, implications, and metadata
